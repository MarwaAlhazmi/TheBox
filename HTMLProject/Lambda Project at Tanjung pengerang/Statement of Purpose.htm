<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Statement
of Purpose</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>I
am going to start by stating way do I need to have a Master degree more than I
want to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>I
am a young Yemeni women living in Saudi Arabia (Non-citizen) in a small town
called Al-Baha where teaching is considered the most secure career for a women.
So I work as a lecturer at Al-Baha University, teaching the required course –
Computer skills for three months now. My career life here is faced with many
obstacles but it only makes me stronger and up to the challenge because that is
who I am.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Upon
graduation from Arab Open University in Jeddah I traveled to my home country -
Yemen - planning on getting a master degree from Sana’a University. In order to
do so I have to get my certificate approved by the ministry of higher
education. Giving that I studied in an open learning system, the certificate
could not be approved because open learning is not accredited in Yemen. So I
worked there for a year in private sector as application developer in
Motorola’s partner in Yemen. As an authorized developer for Motorola, The
Company was starting a new project to build a tracking software application for
Motorola’s two-way digital Radios, which is mainly built to serve the military
police. In the process of designing and building the software I appreciated how
time and performance are highly crucial in such systems. I strived to enrich my
knowledge, develop and build upon my education to be up to the mission, this
experience was the starting point on the path of learning how to build quality
software.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>Due
to family reasons, after this year I returned to Saudi Arabia, and I thought
that one year experience will get me a good job. During my search I noticed
that most of the specialized IT companies in Jeddah only hire men, so during
these months of searching for a job I was faced with many disappointments, but
I never gave up.  I started to work as freelance programmer; I promoted myself
and got some good projects to work on. Freelancing is good but it doesn’t
guarantee a fixed income. So I made sure to improve my skills and
qualifications for the market place by taking two of Microsoft Professional
exams and now I am in the road on taking another two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>My
goal is to build a successful career in the Software Development field; I have
been in the freelancing business for two years until now. And now and I want to
find a developer job in a company where I can guarantee continuous development,
new challenges and meet various expertise in the field and learn from them.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>The
companies here put a huge emphasis on academic qualification. With a Master of
Management and Information Systems my chances of getting a job will be enhanced
by 100%. <span style='color:black'>I believe that graduate study in MIS will be
the most logical extension of my academic pursuits and a major step towards
achieving my objectives.</span></span></p>
